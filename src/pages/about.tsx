        I started my journey as a Bachelor of Physics, but now I&apos;m in love
        with software engineering. I started coding using Fortran in university,
        but I kickstarted my journey in computer science by taking a &quot;6
        months unofficial bootcamp&quot; course of ReactJS with my mentor. After
        that, I landed a job in a software house in Jakarta, and have learned a
        lot about programming since then.

          Gue lulusan Fisika, pernah ngoding dikit pake bahasa Fortran untuk
          skripsi. Habis itu gue nganggur setahun lebih setelah gue lulus
          kuliah. Nah, dari situ gue belajar ngoding. 5 hari seminggu, 8 jam
          sehari. Selama 6 bulan. Yang gue pelajari mulai dari HTML, CSS,
          JavaScript, dan terakhir React. Setelah gue bisa React, gue coba bikin
          3 website sederhana. 1 buat nampilin informasi cuaca, 1 untuk nampilin
          infographics, 1 lagi lupa buat apa. Ini kayaknya gue kerjain dalam
          waktu 1 bulan. Ini disebut portofolio ternyata. Dulu gue belum tau.
          Tapi dengan gue buat ini, temen gue cukup yakin gue bisa mulai kerja.
          Nah, setelah itu gue mulai internship di kantor temen gue selama 2
          bulan. Setelah internship dan cocok, gue mulai kerja sebagai Junior
          Frontend Developer. Alhamdulillah.
          <br />
          <br />
          Jujur waktu jeda kuliah sampai kerja gue cukup lama. 1 tahun lebih dan
          belum jelas arah mau ngapain. Itu rasanya bangun tidur males banget
          gak tau mau ngapain. Tapi pas udah ada kegiatan belajar ngoding rutin
          tersebut, gue kayak punya semangat baru. Walaupun belum tau bakal
          kerja sebagai software engineer, tapi dulu seneng aja waktu
          mempelajari JavaScript, React, cara kerja internet, API, dsb.

        I mainly do front-end and mobile development, using ReactJS,
        ReactNative, and Flutter; but I am also interested in the backend
        technology, NodeJS, Golang, Rust, etc. Currently, my go-to stack is
        NextJS/Remix/CRA, TailwindCSS, React Query, and Prisma. All done
        --mostly-- in TypeScript.

      <h4 className="text-3xl">A place called home, RubyH</h4>
      <p className="text-lg mb-2 tracking-wide">
        As a self-taught software engineer, I started my journey in RubyH.
        It&apos;s a place where I learned so much about software development
        itself. RubyH itself is a software house, so the majority of code I
        write is for a client somewhere, but there is also one internal product.
        As this is the first time I worked, I put myself as &quot;the dumbest
        person&quot; in the room, I asked a lot of things! And it helped me to
        grow really quickly as a software engineer. <br />
        Here, I worked on React project in my first year, and React Native in my
        second year. My role at the start is just as a developer, but at the
        time I leave, I mentor 2 junior react devs and was helping to make
        decisions on front-end technology that was going to be used in projects.
        The product called Moodah --one of the products I loved the most here--
        is a web and mobile app we sell as a SaaS which provides low-cost ERP
        for Indonesian UMKM ( SMEs). Here I worked on the React Native
        client-side app which interacts with the GraphQL backend using Apollo
        Client.
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-3xl">My second home: IDN</h4>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4 tracking-wide">
        Even though Iâ€™m enjoying my time at RubyH, I&apos;m hungry. I&apos;m not
        learning enough. I know my potential is limitless. Then I decided that I
        need to move to a new company: IDN. I came to IDN as a mobile developer.
        But right now I&apos;m happy to call myself just a software engineer.
        This is because, during my time here, I had to switch between product
        teams and technologies several times. I&apos;ll try to highlight the
        most important ones here, as the full summary of my journey is available
        on my CV. <br />
        At IDN, I was given a chance to lead a Flutter mobile app development
        called &quot;Pelajar&quot;. I was always curious to try Flutter, but
        this is the first time that I really had the chance to use it. As the
        lead developer, I need to make quick decisions because the deadline is
        short. My prior knowledge from RubyH really helped me here as I already
        understand the hard concept, e.g., state managers, route management, and
        so on. Alhamdulillah, I managed to release the app to Google Play Store,
        and not only that, being a good communicator between Engineering,
        Product, and Customer Support team. The team consists of 3 mobile devs,
        2 backend devs, a QA, and a product lead.
        <br />
        The second role I wanted to highlight is when I was asked to help the
        Pordi team. It&apos;s a difficult decision to leave a product that I
        raised like my own child, but I also understand the impact of this
        product on IDN, thus I decided to move. Here, I meet ReactJS again, one
        of my loved frameworks, and help the team to meet the release date of
        the revamped Pordi web apps. I learned NextJS and React Query here while
        also working on a lot of features and bugs. I also started to use git
        rebase daily. At the end of the day, the web app is released.
